              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                From August 26, 2025 to December 19, 2025, I worked as a Student IT Technician with Computing and
                Communications Services at the University of Guelph. During this four-month co-op term, I provided
                technical support for the Managed Desktops service while building skills in troubleshooting, client
                communication, and enterprise systems administration. What started as an introduction to professional IT
                work became an experience that shaped my technical abilities and understanding of how technology works
                in real organizations. This report reflects on that growth and the lessons I learned throughout the
                term.
              </p>

              <h3 class="mt-5">Computing and Communications Services</h3>

              <div class="row align-items-center my-4">

                  <p>
                    Computing and Communications Services works as the central IT department for the University of
                    Guelph,
                    managing the technology infrastructure that supports daily operations across campus. The department
                    handles a wide range of services:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Email and collaboration platforms through Gryph Mail and Office 365</li>
                    <li>Network and telecommunications infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Information security and identity management</li>
                    <li>Software licensing and distribution</li>
                    <li>Web development and solutions</li>
                    <li>Full technical support for the university community</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The size of CCS operations is significant. Thousands of students, faculty, and staff rely on these
                    systems for everything from research computing to administrative work to online learning. This
                    creates a
                    complex technical environment where reliability matters and problems affect real work. The
                    department
                    approaches this responsibility through core values of service culture, integrity, individual
                    leadership,
                    teamwork, agility, and communication.

              <h3 class="mt-4">The Managed Desktops Division</h3>
              <p>
                I worked within Managed Desktops, a service that provides full desktop management, security, and support
                for university departments. Rather than keeping their own IT staff and infrastructure, departments can
                subscribe to this service and receive professional management of their computing environment. The
                service covers the complete desktop lifecycle:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Computer procurement, setup, and provisioning</li>
                <li>Software deployment and configuration</li>
                <li>Security maintenance through SentinelOne EDR</li>
                <li>Hardware coordination, repairs, and replacements</li>
                <li>Ongoing troubleshooting and technical support</li>
                <li>Management using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="mt-5">Goals</h2>
              <p>
                I approached this work term with specific learning objectives designed to build both technical skills
                and professional capabilities essential for a career in IT. These goals were developed in consultation
                with my supervisor and aligned with the core competencies expected in the Managed Desktops role.

                      <div class="collapse mt-3" id="goal1">
                        <p>One of my primary goals was to develop clear and effective oral communication skills to
                          explain technical concepts to non-technical clients and collaborate efficiently with team
                          members. At the beginning of the term, I found myself using technical jargon when explaining
                          issues to clients without checking if they understood what I meant. To improve, I made a
                          conscious effort to practice explaining technical issues in plain language during each client
                          interaction, using analogies and comparisons that related to everyday experiences. I also paid
                          close attention to experienced team members during client calls, noting how they structured
                          explanations and adjusted their approach based on client responses.</p>
                        <p>By the end of the term, I saw measurable improvement in this area. I received positive
                          feedback on my communication skills during performance reviews, achieved several gold star
                          reviews from clients, and noticed a reduction in follow-up calls on issues I had handled. This
                          goal was largely successful, though there were still occasional situations where I struggled
                          to find the right words or level of explanation for highly technical issues.</p>

                        <p>Another major goal was to enhance my systematic troubleshooting skills to efficiently
                          diagnose and resolve complex technical issues. When I started, my troubleshooting approach was
                          somewhat haphazard, trying solutions without always understanding why. I worked on developing
                          a more structured methodology by documenting my troubleshooting process for challenging
                          tickets, collaborating with senior team members to understand their problem-solving
                          approaches, and creating a personal knowledge base of common issues and solutions.</p>
                        <p>Over the course of the term, my average ticket resolution time decreased steadily and I
                          successfully resolved approximately 80% of my assigned tickets without needing to escalate to
                          senior staff. I also identified and documented two significant process improvements for
                          handling account creation issues and printer configuration problems. This goal was largely
                          achieved, though some complex multi-system issues still required significant time and
                          collaboration to resolve.</p>

                        <p>A key objective for this term was to expand my technical knowledge across the range of
                          technologies supported in the CCS Managed Desktops service, including Active Directory,
                          Windows and macOS systems, and enterprise management tools. I maintained a learning journal
                          throughout the term, deliberately volunteered for diverse ticket types to gain exposure to
                          various technologies, and regularly used the CCS SharePoint knowledge base and ticketing
                          system as learning tools. I made particularly strong progress in understanding Active
                          Directory and how it connects to various other systems.</p>
                        <p>By the end of the term, I had very few tickets reopened because of knowledge gaps, which
                          indicated that my technical understanding was solid enough to provide lasting solutions.
                          However, this goal highlighted areas where I still have significant learning ahead, as
                          enterprise IT environments are vast and four months only scratches the surface. Technologies
                          like Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager and advanced security tools remain areas where I
                          need continued learning, but I successfully built a strong foundation and learned how to learn
                          in a technical environment.</p>

                          assistance to colleagues during high-volume periods, handled sensitive client information
                          according to university policies, and acknowledged mistakes promptly when they occurred. This

                <h3>Reflection on Goals Overall</h3>
                <p>
                  Looking back across all my goals, I successfully achieved most of what I set out to accomplish. My
                  communication skills improved measurably, my troubleshooting became more systematic and efficient, my
                  technical knowledge expanded significantly, and I contributed positively to team dynamics. The goals I
                  did not fully complete were primarily in the depth of technical knowledge, simply because the breadth
                  of enterprise IT is so vast that four months can only provide foundational understanding. The skills
                  and knowledge gained will benefit my next work experience by providing a strong foundation that
                  transfers across different IT roles and environments.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                As a Student IT Technician within the Managed Desktops division, I provided comprehensive technical
                support for university departments enrolled in the service. My daily work involved:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Troubleshooting hardware and software issues across Windows and macOS systems</li>
                <li>Managing user accounts in Active Directory</li>
                <li>Deploying software through Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager</li>
                <li>Administering endpoint security through SentinelOne EDR</li>
                <li>Handling support tickets through BMC FootPrints</li>
                <li>Balancing desk-side visits for complex problems with remote support for quick fixes</li>
                <li>Working with technologies from network printers and peripheral devices to email systems and file
                  storage</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Most Interesting Aspects</h3>
              <p>
                The most interesting aspect of this role was the variety and unpredictability of each day. One moment I
                might be diagnosing why a specific software package failed to deploy across multiple computers, and the
                next I would be helping a frustrated faculty member recover important files or troubleshoot a network
                connectivity issue. Each ticket presented a unique puzzle that required both technical knowledge and
                interpersonal skills to solve effectively. What made the work particularly engaging was seeing the
                direct impact of my efforts when a client could get back to their work or when I identified a solution
                that could help prevent similar issues for others.

              <h2 class="mt-5">Conclusions</h2>
              <p>
                Looking back on this four-month work term, what stands out most is how much I grew not just
                technically,
                but professionally. When I first started, I was focused on learning the basics of enterprise IT
                support
                and becoming comfortable in the role. Over time, I developed the confidence to handle complex
                technical
                issues independently, communicate clearly with clients who had varying levels of technical
                knowledge,
                and contribute meaningfully to a collaborative team environment. This role strengthened my technical
                skills across Windows and macOS systems, Active Directory, enterprise management tools, and security
                platforms. However, it also reinforced that IT support is fundamentally people-focused. I learned to
                be
                more patient and adaptable in my interactions, especially when supporting users who were frustrated
                or
                overwhelmed by technical problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, this work term confirmed my interest in IT and gave me a strong foundation to build on
                moving
                forward. I feel more confident in my problem-solving abilities, more comfortable taking initiative
                when
                faced with unfamiliar challenges, and better prepared to handle both technical complexities and the
                human aspects of technology work. Working closely with my teammates, learning from experienced
                analysts
                and technicians, and building strong professional relationships helped me grow as both a
                communicator
                and a collaborator. If someone were to describe this experience, I would want them to say that I
                approached this work term with clear goals, worked systematically to achieve them, and left with
                practical skills and insights that will serve me throughout my career. I am proud of the growth I
                achieved and grateful for the experiences, mentorship, and relationships that made it possible.

                I want to thank Haniya Saleh, my supervisor, for providing guidance, constructive feedback, and
                support
                throughout this work term. Her willingness to answer questions, share knowledge, and trust me with
                meaningful responsibilities made this a valuable learning experience. I also thank my colleagues on
                the
                Managed Desktops team and my fellow co-op students for creating a collaborative and supportive work
                environment. The knowledge shared, help offered, and professional relationships built made this term
                both productive and enjoyable. Finally, I thank the University of Guelph's Co-operative Education
                program and Computing and Communications Services for this opportunity.
              </p>
