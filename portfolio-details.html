              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                From August 26, 2025 to December 19, 2025, I worked as a Student IT Technician with Computing and Communications Services at the University of Guelph. During this four-month co-op term, I provided technical support for the Managed Desktops service while building skills in troubleshooting, client communication, and enterprise systems administration. What started as an introduction to professional IT work became an experience that shaped my technical abilities and understanding of how technology works in real organizations. This report reflects on that growth and the lessons I learned throughout the term.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mt-5">Information about the Employer</h2>
              <h3>Computing and Communications Services</h3>
              <p>
                Computing and Communications Services works as the central IT department for the University of Guelph, managing the technology infrastructure that supports daily operations across campus. The department handles a wide range of services: email and collaboration platforms through Gryph Mail and Office 365, network and telecommunications infrastructure, information security and identity management, software licensing and distribution, web development, and full technical support for the university community.
              </p>
              <p>
                The size of CCS operations is significant. Thousands of students, faculty, and staff rely on these systems for everything from research computing to administrative work to online learning. This creates a complex technical environment where reliability matters and problems affect real work. The department approaches this responsibility through core values of service culture, integrity, individual leadership, teamwork, agility, and communication.
              </p>

              <h3 class="mt-4">The Managed Desktops Division</h3>
              <p>
                I worked within Managed Desktops, a service that provides full desktop management, security, and support for university departments. Rather than keeping their own IT staff and infrastructure, departments can subscribe to this service and receive professional management of their computing environment. The service covers the complete desktop lifecycle, including computer setup, software deployment, security maintenance through SentinelOne EDR, hardware coordination, and ongoing troubleshooting support using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager as the main management platform.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mt-5">Goals</h2>
              <p>
                I approached this work term with specific learning objectives designed to build both technical skills and professional capabilities essential for a career in IT. These goals were developed in consultation with my supervisor and aligned with the core competencies expected in the Managed Desktops role.

              <h2 class="mt-5">Job Description</h2>
              
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                As a Student IT Technician within the Managed Desktops division, I provided comprehensive technical support for university departments enrolled in the service. My daily work involved troubleshooting hardware and software issues across Windows and macOS systems, managing user accounts in Active Directory, deploying software through Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, administering endpoint security through SentinelOne EDR, and handling support tickets through BMC FootPrints. I balanced desk-side visits for complex problems with remote support for quick fixes, and worked with technologies ranging from network printers and peripheral devices to email systems and file storage.
              </p>

              <h3>Most Interesting Aspects</h3>
              <p>
                The most interesting aspect of this role was the variety and unpredictability of each day. One moment I might be diagnosing why a specific software package failed to deploy across multiple computers, and the next I would be helping a frustrated faculty member recover important files or troubleshoot a network connectivity issue. Each ticket presented a unique puzzle that required both technical knowledge and interpersonal skills to solve effectively. What made the work particularly engaging was seeing the direct impact of my efforts when a client could get back to their work or when I identified a solution that could help prevent similar issues for others.
              </p>

              <h3>Skills and Learning</h3>
              <p>
                The skills I needed for this job came from both my academic background and on-the-job learning. My computer science coursework provided foundational knowledge about operating systems, networking concepts, and general problem-solving approaches that helped me understand how systems work and why issues occur. However, the practical skills needed for enterprise IT support, such as working with Active Directory, using management tools like MECM, troubleshooting in live production environments, and communicating effectively with non-technical clients, were learned almost entirely on the job. The most valuable skill I developed was the ability to learn quickly and independently, using available resources like documentation, knowledge bases, and experienced colleagues to build competence in unfamiliar areas.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mt-5">Conclusions</h2>
              <p>
                Looking back on this four-month work term, what stands out most is how much I grew not just technically, but professionally. When I first started, I was focused on learning the basics of enterprise IT support and becoming comfortable in the role. Over time, I developed the confidence to handle complex technical issues independently, communicate clearly with clients who had varying levels of technical knowledge, and contribute meaningfully to a collaborative team environment. This role strengthened my technical skills across Windows and macOS systems, Active Directory, enterprise management tools, and security platforms. However, it also reinforced that IT support is fundamentally people-focused. I learned to be more patient and adaptable in my interactions, especially when supporting users who were frustrated or overwhelmed by technical problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, this work term confirmed my interest in IT and gave me a strong foundation to build on moving forward. I feel more confident in my problem-solving abilities, more comfortable taking initiative when faced with unfamiliar challenges, and better prepared to handle both technical complexities and the human aspects of technology work. Working closely with my teammates, learning from experienced analysts and technicians, and building strong professional relationships helped me grow as both a communicator and a collaborator. If someone were to describe this experience, I would want them to say that I approached this work term with clear goals, worked systematically to achieve them, and left with practical skills and insights that will serve me throughout my career. I am proud of the growth I achieved and grateful for the experiences, mentorship, and relationships that made it possible.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mt-5">Acknowledgments</h2>
              <p>
                I want to thank Jill Hogg, my supervisor, for providing guidance, constructive feedback, and support throughout this work term. Her willingness to answer questions, share knowledge, and trust me with meaningful responsibilities made this a valuable learning experience. I also thank my colleagues on the Managed Desktops team and my fellow co-op students for creating a collaborative and supportive work environment. The knowledge shared, help offered, and professional relationships built made this term both productive and enjoyable. Finally, I thank the University of Guelph's Co-operative Education program and Computing and Communications Services for this opportunity.
